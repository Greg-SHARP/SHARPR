survey concluded that stress is an epidemic for children and
families. For students, stress impairs attention, mood, sleep, and
learning readiness. For teachers, stress can decrease productivity
and creativity and increase frustration and anxiety. For parents,
stress can lead to a parenting style that looks more like a
to-do list than an engaged, empathetic, and present relationship
with their children. The benefits of a practice of mindfulness—
by all of the aforementioned—include improved attention and
focus, self-control, resilience and adaptability, and compassion.
