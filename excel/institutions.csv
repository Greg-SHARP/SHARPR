Westport Continuing Education,westport@wc.edu,203-341-1209,westport_continuing_ed.png,Westport,,CT,6880,https://www.westportcontinuinged.com/,"What is it about September that signals new beginnings? I suppose that every season presents an opportunity for change of one kind or another, but theres something about the fall that demands renewal--though autumn is the season when nature, at least, puts itself to bed. I am long past my own years of back-to-school preparations, and although my sons technically go back to school in September, they do so largely independently. By the time we pack up the car to shuttle them north and norther, theyve by and large taken care of their own back-to-school shopping. Theyve laid in a store of the things that boys need to survive on their own for the few months between their first day back at college and the Thanksgiving break, and theyve diligently organized and carefully packed thrown those things in the various duffel bags and trunks that we now own. (And let me be clear: their list-of-things-that-boys-need-tosurvive-on-their-own does not match the list I might have drawn up for them, were I allowed any longer to make such lists.) Be that as it sadly may, still, I go ""back to school"" each September, if only metaphor - ically. And it is with that sense of return and renewal that we put the Fall catalog together. So if you are, like me, an empty nester, we have just the thing: a workshop to help you survive and even thrive in your emptier (but happily cleaner) house. Brighten that home by crafting your very own beeswax candles, or repurpose one of those now-empty bedrooms... but make sure to take our new Feng Shui workshop first. For actual back-to-schoolers, we have new cooking and STEM classes. And for your back-to-schoolers who are about the leave the nest? Try our new Comm App workshop. Cuz you cant keep em down on the farm (or, apparently, teach them anything about packing), but you can make sure that they have what they need to survive the process that will launch them into the world.
