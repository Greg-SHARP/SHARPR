Her remarkable talent became evident in her early years, and was perfected through her various experiences over the last 30 years. Throughout Sue's life one thing has remained constant -- her creative passion and enthusiasm for her life's work. 
Sue has been creative in many mediums throughout her life: ceramics, clay, enamel, and metal sculptures, and jewelry fabrication and design. In high school, Sue realized jewelry design, and teaching others to make jewelry was in her future. While attending Boston University's School of Artistry, she was offered and accepted a teaching position in the Adult Ed program for Basic and Advanced Jewelry Fabrication. 
Sue had the opportunity to work along side well-known designers in the jewelry industry before embarking on managerial positions. She was responsible for overseeing the quality of workmanship for up to 15 jewelers and 3 designers at a time in her first retail environment. Sue thrived in the retail jewelry environment because of her extraordinary abilities and skills to communicate with customers. She will draw and fabricate or carve a wax simulation to meet or exceed a customer's expectation. 
When asked what Sue likes most about working at Kasson Jewelers, she said: ""I like Susan and Alan Kasson's warm honest approach to serving customers, and their integrity in running a successful jewelry business. And the artistic creative freedom to help customers bring their ideas to life and make their dreams come true."""
